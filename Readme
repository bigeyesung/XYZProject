#I am using python3.6 in Linux and Conda env.

Q1
    1-1:
        I use 2 assumptions in this question, but it definitely can do improvement.
            #Assuming we have the same car lengths for each row
            #Assuming entrace(empty space) must be on either side of our walk path
    1-2:
        #Input: 2D array
        #Output: integer
        #Corner case: empty 2D array
        #Corner case: we have only 1 car in each row

Q2
    I found a solution regarding M==N, it is listed on the comments.
Q3
    3-1:
        #Assuming each visited landmark only exists once. 
    3-2:
        In LandmarkSLAM class, it has "GetOverlap", "GetOverlap_v2"  and "GetOverlap_v3" functions.
        The former is the current one working solution. but it has O(N**3) time complexity.
        Thus, the later two are the improved versions. These versions are still buggy and need to be refactered.
        But I think given we have threed sorted arrays, it definitely needs to improve the algorithm. The further explnation is 
        on the comments. 

Q4
    4-1:
    Required libraries:
    #conda install pybind11 pybind11-abi pybind11-global
    #pip install sophuspy

    4-2:Other interpolation:
        if the data is only two-dimensional(x,y):
            First idea came to my mind is to try natural exponent, log, or sin/cos functions. interpolating withion the range.
            Given we have N+1 points, we can use Lagrange,Newton polynomial or Taylor series to find N polynomial. Interpolating withion the range.
        if the data is three-dimensional (x,y,z):
            We can use Bezier curves, Hermite curves, or splines interpolation. E.g. Catmull-Rom spline interpolation
            In Python, we can refer scipy package.
            https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html
            Further, I found one paper mentions affine interpolation for Lie Group. It says not only interpolate in 0<=t<=1, also
            in can use in t>1 or t<0. Definitely it needs further investigation.

Q5
    I attached a picture. Let me know if it is not clear.
